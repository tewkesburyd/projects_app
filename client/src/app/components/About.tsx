                    Hello! My name is David, and I am a passionate and driven web developer. My journey in the tech world began in 2021 when I took my first web development course at a community college. It was there where I discovered my love for coding and my interest in building beautiful and user-friendly web applications.
                  </p>

                <div className="prose prose-indigo mx-auto mt-5 text-silver lg:col-start-1 lg:row-start-1 lg:max-w-none">
                  <p className="mt-5">
                    I have always had a passion for creating things, whether it be with my camera, my hands or crafting web applications. This led me to further my education and skills by attending <Link href="https://flatironschool.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" className='text-aqua not-italic no-underline'>Flatiron School</Link> where I graduated as a full-stack web developer.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-5">
                    I am now on the lookout for new and exciting opportunities to showcase my skills and continue growing as a developer. My favorite frameworks include <em className='text-aqua not-italic'>React, TailwindCSS, and Next.js</em>. I love the versatility and power that these tools bring to web development and the endless possibilities they offer.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-5">
                    In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, photography, and DIY projects. I am always eager to learn something new and am dedicated to delivering high-quality work. I believe in the power of collaboration and enjoy working with a team to bring ideas to life. If you are looking for a driven and dedicated web developer, I would love the opportunity to chat with you further.
